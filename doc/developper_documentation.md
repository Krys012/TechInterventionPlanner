# TechInterventionPlanner - Developer Documentation

## Architecture Overview

TechInterventionPlanner is designed as a console application using multiple design patterns to ensure a clean architecture, extensibility, and maintainability. The application follows a modular approach with clear separation of concerns.

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Factory Method**: For creation of different intervention types
2. **Decorator**: For dynamically adding capabilities to interventions
3. **Facade**: For providing a simplified interface to the subsystems
4. **Observer**: For event notification between components
5. **Proxy**: For access control to intervention management operations

## Key Components

### Models

- `Intervention`: Abstract base class for all intervention types
- `MaintenanceIntervention`: Regular maintenance intervention
- `EmergencyIntervention`: Urgent interventions with priority level
- `Technician`: Represents a technician with skills and availability

### Business Logic

- `InterventionPlanner`: Manages scheduling of interventions
- `TechnicianManager`: Handles technician assignments and availability
- `NotificationSystem`: Manages notifications to various recipients

### Factories

- `InterventionFactory`: Base factory interface
- `MaintenanceFactory`: Factory for maintenance interventions
- `EmergencyFactory`: Factory for emergency interventions
- `InterventionFactoryRegistry`: Registry of available factories

### Decorators

- `InterventionDecorator`: Base decorator interface
- `GPSTrackingDecorator`: Adds GPS tracking capability
- `AttachmentsDecorator`: Adds file attachment capability

### Facade & Proxy

- `InterventionManager`: Facade that orchestrates all operations
- `IInterventionManager`: Interface for manager operations
- `InterventionManagerSecure`: Proxy that adds security checks

### Command Line Interface

- `CLI`: Main interface class
- `AuthenticationSystem`: Handles user authentication and permissions

## Data Flow

1. User enters commands through the CLI
2. CLI delegates to the secure manager (proxy)
3. Proxy checks permissions and forwards to the real manager (facade)
4. Manager orchestrates business logic components
5. Results are returned back through the chain

## In-Memory Data Management

The system operates with in-memory data storage only. All interventions, technicians, and other data are stored in memory during runtime and are lost when the application terminates. This design decision means:

- No state persistence between sessions
- Faster operation without disk I/O bottlenecks
- Simpler implementation without database dependencies

To provide users with data persistence options, the system implements the following:

1. **Sample Data Initialization**: The `initialize` command populates the system with sample data
2. **Data Export**: The `export` command allows exporting current data to files (text, CSV, JSON)

## Data Export Implementation

The export functionality is implemented in the `InterventionManager::exportSchedule()` method, which:

1. Opens an output file stream
2. Formats data according to the requested format (text, CSV, JSON)
3. Writes all intervention data to the file
4. Closes the stream and returns a success/failure status

Supported formats include:
- Plain text: Human-readable summary
- CSV: For spreadsheet applications
- JSON: For integration with other systems

## Adding New Features

### Adding a New Intervention Type

1. Create a new class that inherits from `Intervention`
2. Implement the required methods, especially `getType()`
3. Create a corresponding factory class inheriting from `InterventionFactory`
4. Register the new factory in `main.cpp`:

```cpp
auto& registry = InterventionFactoryRegistry::getInstance();
registry.registerFactory("NewType", std::make_unique<NewTypeFactory>());
```

### Adding a New Decorator

1. Create a new class inheriting from `InterventionDecorator`
2. Implement decorator-specific functionality
3. Override `getInfo()` to include the new information
4. Add methods to apply the decorator in `InterventionManager`
5. Update the CLI to expose the new decorator functionality

### Adding CLI Commands

1. Add a new handler method in `CLI` class:

```cpp
void CLI::handleNewCommand(const std::vector<std::string>& args) {
    // Command implementation
}
```

2. Register the command in `CLI::initializeCommands()`:

```cpp
commandHandlers["newcomm"] = [this](const auto& args) { handleNewCommand(args); };
commandHelp["newcomm"] = "Description of the new command";
```

## Performance Considerations

- The system uses STL containers for efficient data management
- Unique pointers are used for automatic memory management
- Observers use smart pointers to prevent memory leaks
- The facade pattern minimizes coupling between components

## Error Handling

The system implements error handling through:

1. Return values for operation success/failure
2. Exception handling for unexpected errors
3. Input validation at the CLI level
4. Access control checks in the proxy

## Testing Guidelines

When adding new features, consider implementing tests for:

1. Factory creation of new intervention types
2. Decorator behavior and chaining
3. Edge cases in scheduling logic
4. Access control and permission checks

## Future Development Directions

1. **Database Integration**: Could be added as a storage strategy implementation
2. **REST API**: For integration with web services
3. **GUI**: Could be implemented using Qt or another framework
4. **Mobile Notifications**: Could be added to the notification system
5. **Reporting**: More advanced reporting and statistics
